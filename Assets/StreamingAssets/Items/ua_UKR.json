    "A tech wristband that Ernest says is supposed to get me back to base if things get really bad. It also lets me check my vitals, whatever that means.",
     "My father's axe. He used to cut down the old trees in the forest with it to allow new ones to grow, and now I have to use it to destroy the cursed tree to save humanity.",
     "They are so comfortable and light. It feels like my movements are faster when I put them on! (+0.1 to attack speed).",
     "Touch boots... Of course, I've heard about touch phones, but here are the boots... Well, the main thing is that I move faster in them, everything else somehow doesn't bother me. (+1 speed)",
     "Somehow this blade works strangely. Every time I damage myself with it, my hits get stronger! (+10 damage, -5% health).",
     "Maybe it's a little heavy, but it doesn't protect well. (+100 health, -2 speed)",
     "A web is there, a web is here. It's everywhere. Even if there isn't a web somewhere, it's only a matter of time before it appears.",
     "No matter how curious I am, just the thought of what might grow from this seed gives me the creeps.",
     "Sap from a real live tree. I wonder if I got it from a living creature, does that count as blood?",
     "Just a piece from the root I destroyed."
